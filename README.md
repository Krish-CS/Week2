# Water Quality Prediction – Week 2 (Enhanced Version)

This enhanced version builds upon the Week 1 base model to include in-depth analysis, visualizations, and improved evaluation methods. This project is part of the AICTE Virtual Internship (June 2025) supported by Shell.

## 📌 Objective

Enhance the water quality prediction model with:
- Correlation analysis
- Graphical evaluation (Actual vs. Predicted)
- Better data insights for environmental forecasting

---

## 🔍 Key Improvements

- Added correlation heatmap using `seaborn`
- Scatter plots for actual vs. predicted pollutant levels
- Refactored code for modularity and clarity
- Model evaluation for each pollutant retained

---

## 🧪 Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3.12
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- `Scikit-learn`, `Joblib`
- Jupyter Notebook
